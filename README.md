# Laasya's Portfolio ♡  
```
This is my personal portfolio  
A little corner of the internet where I keep all the things I’ve built, designed, and maybe overthought ♡

Built with plain ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ♡   
No frameworks, no libraries  
Just me and the code

Everything’s tucked neatly inside the `assets` folder ♡   
Because chaos *stresses* me out
```

## Look but don’t steal ♡  
```
Feel free to explore and get inspired  
But don’t copy or clone this project  
You can take notes like a decent human ♡ 
You can give credit if this helped you build something cool  
But this work stays mine
```
## Why this exists ♡  
```
Because I wanted something that *actually* looks like me  
Not another portfolio template  
Not another generic scroll fest  
Just something that feels right  
Clean design, smooth scroll, and a little attitude ♡
