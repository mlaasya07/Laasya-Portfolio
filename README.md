# Laasya's Portfolio â™¡  

This is my personal portfolio  
A little corner of the internet where I keep all the things Iâ€™ve built, designed, and maybe overthought ðŸ’­

Built with plain ol' HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â™¡   
No frameworks, no libraries  
Just me and the code

Everythingâ€™s tucked neatly inside the `assets` folder â™¡   
Because chaos stresses me out

## Look but donâ€™t steal â™¡  

Feel free to explore and get inspired  
But donâ€™t copy or clone this project  
You can take notes like a decent human â™¡ 
You can give credit if this helped you build something cool  
But this work stays mine

## Why this exists â™¡  

Because I wanted something that *actually* looks like me  
Not another portfolio template  
Not another generic scroll fest  
Just something that feels right  
Clean design, smooth scroll, and a little attitude â™¡
